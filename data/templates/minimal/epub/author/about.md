Dale Hartley Emery has worked as a failed shoemaker, reluctant dairy farmer, and ruthless ice cream man. For several years he monitored the nuclear test ban treaty, making sure those pesky commies didn’t blow up the planet. (They didn’t.)

He prefers writing.

When he isn’t writing, Dale advises software teams and leaders about how to play nice together. Colleagues in Dale’s industry once created a special award for him for being reasonable.

Dale lives in California with his wife.
